# shapes-destroyer-c

This is just a little study project made with C and SDL3.
Hopefully I'll limit myself only to SDL3 as a library, I know is quite big but I never wrote anything in C before so is a trade of I'm willing to make before going deeper.


## Objective

Make a tuned down version of Geometry Wars and use only SDL3 as an external library.

## Why?

I want to limit only to SDL3 as an external library in order to understand how to make stuff in C.

I would like to implement myself everything I could need for the game. For example an ECS Framework, a basic one obviously, but I want to try.
The idea is to face problems and solve them in C and learn from the experience.
