# shapes-destroyer-c

This is just a little study project made with C and SDL3.
Hopefully I'll limit myself only to SDL3 as a library, I know is quite big but I never wrote anything in C before so is a trade of I'm willing to make before going deeper.

The idea is to make a really tuned down (or not, we'll see how it goes) version of Geometry Wars.

## Objective

I don't really need an objective for this project but I'll give one myself anyway. I want to understand how to do stuff in C, I've always used high level languages and while using Rust for another hobby project I understod that I don't know enough but Rust seems to have too much complexity, maybe some of it not really necessary, to let me understand the basic of a good programming language.
I don't say C is but on the surface it seems easy enough to let me try complicated stuff without too much fuss around it.
